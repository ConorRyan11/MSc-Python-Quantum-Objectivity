# MSc-Python-Quantum-Objectivity
Using Qiskit, the results contained in Figure 7 of the attached paper "Witnessing non-objectivity in the framework of strong quantum Darwinism, Thao P Le and Alexandra Olaya-Castro 2020 Quantum Sci. Technol. 5 045012(2020)" were reproduced. These results focus on the creating of a quantum circuit to act as a witness to detect non-objectivity through the comparison of the time evolution of a system-environment state with and without the objectivity operation applied.\
This project was completed with the assitance of Prof. Felix Binder and Dr Alessandro Candeloro from the Quantum Information Theory Group in Trinity College Dublin.
